# Procedural-Adventure-
## A simple Adventure game, with basic mechanics.

This test game allows you to start quests in the world of Precedural.\
So When you first run the 'main.py' file, you will be prompted to enter a name for your character, and a selection of classes to choose from.\
### the main starting choices at first will be:

- Start a quest = starts a random procedural quest
- View Character Stats = lets you view your stats
- Exit Game = self explanatory

### combat system
during combat, you will get four initial choices:\
- Attack = lets you pick from 3 different abilities to attack your opponent
- use item = lets you view your inventory(useless ATM)
- Run = lets you escape from your enemy, UNLESS its a Boss
- Defend = lets you defend(Useless ATM)

### Disclaimer
there are still some choices that are not really useful, but the main reason for this project is to test the combat system and to get a feel for coding procedural quests and combat between enemies.
